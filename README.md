# Single Page Application 
Demo:  https://luisanegri.github.io/filme

## Overview

>SPA created for people who like films and would like to know more information about it.

## UX

The user can search for films by typing any query on the search box and a list of films with that query is displayed. 
A list of the most popular films is displayed on the top of the page. 
It is also displayed the "Best Rated Animation" and "Coming soon" posters.
Each film has its own details that it is displayed on another page, it shows the poster, title, genre, rating, and its website.
From the details page, the user can see a list of recommendations according to the specific film.

## Wireframe

I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for creating the website design.
